## 📌 About the Project  
This is my **Second internship task at Prodigy Infotech**.  
I developed a simple **Employee Management System** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

It allows users to **add, view, update, and delete employee records** directly in the browser using **LocalStorage**.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add new employees (Name, ID, Role, Department, Salary)  
- 📋 View all employees in a table format  
- ✏️ Update employee details  
- ❌ Delete employees  
- 💾 Data stored in **LocalStorage** (no database required)

## 🖥️ How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository  
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser  
3. Start adding employees and manage records
